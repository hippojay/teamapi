# User Authentication UI Update

## Problem
The login and logout functionality were inconsistently placed in the UI. The login button was in the sidebar footer, while the user profile and logout button were in the top-right corner of the header. This created a confusing user experience, as users had to look in different places to perform related authentication actions.

## Solution
We consolidated all authentication-related UI elements to the sidebar footer with a clean, space-efficient design:

1. **Before Login**
   - The login button remains in the sidebar footer
   - Styled with blue accent to indicate its action

2. **After Login**
   - Username with user icon replaces the login button in the same position
   - Right-facing chevron icon indicates expandable menu to the right
   - Clicking on username reveals logout option in a dropdown to the right
   - Logout option is styled with red accent for clear differentiation

3. **Header Simplification**
   - Removed the user profile menu from the header
   - Redistributed header space for better balance
   - Moved search component to the right side for better visibility

4. **Interaction Improvements**
   - Added click-outside detection to automatically close the user menu
   - Menu appears to the right of the username button for better visibility
   - Traditional dropdown pattern for familiarity and consistency
   - Single-action menu keeps the UI focused and minimal

## UX Benefits
- **Consistency**: All authentication-related actions are now in the same location
- **Space Efficiency**: Username replaces login button rather than adding additional UI elements
- **Predictability**: Users always know where to find login/logout functionality
- **Clarity**: Clear visual separation between username (neutral) and logout (red accent)
- **Simplification**: Streamlined UI with expandable menu only when needed
- **Mobile-friendly**: This approach will adapt better to smaller screens if implemented in the future

## Technical Implementation
- Used conditional rendering to toggle between login button and username
- Implemented React's useRef and useEffect hooks for click-outside detection
- Added dropdown menu that appears to the right of the username button
- Styled components to maintain visual hierarchy and accessibility
- Simplified header layout by removing the now-unused user profile section
