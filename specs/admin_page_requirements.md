# Admin Page Requirements

This document captures the requirements for the Admin Page refactoring work.

## User Needs

1. The admin dashboard should have a modular, maintainable structure
2. Code should be reusable across different parts of the application
3. Components should follow React best practices and be easier to maintain
4. Similar functionality should be grouped into reusable components
5. The UI should remain functionally identical to the original implementation
6. Maintain dark mode and light mode support across all components
7. Ensure admin-only access is preserved for all admin functionality
8. Code should be well-structured and follow modern software engineering methods
9. Security and data privacy considerations should be maintained
10. The application should be easy to modify and extend in the future

## Specific Components Required

1. Tab Navigation
   - Support for switching between users, settings, audit logs, and data upload

2. User Management
   - Users list with search functionality
   - User editing capabilities
   - Add new user modal

3. System Settings 
   - Settings list with edit capabilities
   - Add new settings modal

4. Audit Logs
   - Display audit logs in a tabular format
   - Support for filtering and sorting (future enhancement)

5. Data Upload
   - Selection of data type (organization, services, dependencies)
   - File upload interface supporting Excel and CSV files
   - Worksheet selection for Excel files
   - Dry run option for testing uploads
   - Display of upload results

6. Common UI Elements
   - Error alerts
   - Loading indicators
   - Modals for adding/editing content

## Additional Implementation Notes

1. React components are placed in `/frontend/src/components/admin/` directory
2. All components support dark mode and light mode through the `darkMode` prop
3. State management is done at the parent level (AdminPage.jsx)
4. Components receive data and callbacks as props following React best practices
5. Sensitive operations are properly secured with error handling
