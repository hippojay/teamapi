# UI Requirements

This document captures UI-related requirements for the "Who What Where" application.

## UI Elements

1. **Login Button**
   - Remove the key icon from the Login button on the login page
   - Keep the text "Log In" or "Logging in..." when loading
   - Maintain all existing styles and functionality

## General UI Considerations

1. **Component Reusability**
   - Find duplicated UI code and convert to reusable React components
   - Create a consistent component library

2. **Styling**
   - Maintain consistent styling across the application
   - Support both light and dark modes

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Ensure all UI elements work properly on different screen sizes
   - Support mobile and desktop views

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure UI components are accessible
   - Provide appropriate aria attributes for interactive elements
