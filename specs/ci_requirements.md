# CI Implementation Requirements

## MyPy Static Type Checking

- Integrate MyPy into the CI pipeline to perform static type checking on Python code
- Configure MyPy to check models, schemas, and routes with appropriate strictness levels
- Set up MyPy to fail the build on critical type errors
- Provide clear documentation on how to use type annotations in the codebase
- Create an example of properly typed models to guide developers

## Bandit Security Scanning

- Integrate Bandit into the CI pipeline to perform security scanning on Python code
- Configure Bandit to identify common security vulnerabilities
- Generate reports in JSON format for record keeping and in screen format for immediate feedback
- Exclude test files and virtual environments from scanning
- Provide clear documentation on how to address common security issues
- Focus on medium and high severity issues in CI output

## User Needs Identified

1. Need to enforce type safety in Python code to catch errors before they reach production
2. Need to maintain a consistent approach to type annotations across the codebase
3. Need automated verification of type correctness during CI builds
4. Need to gradually introduce typing to the existing codebase without breaking functionality
5. Need clear guidance for developers on how to properly add type annotations
6. Need to identify security vulnerabilities in Python code early in the development process
7. Need to prevent common security anti-patterns from being introduced into the codebase
8. Need documentation on security best practices for Python development
9. Need automated security scanning as part of the CI pipeline
10. Need regular reporting on security issues found in the codebase
11. Need to properly exclude example and documentation files from CI checks
