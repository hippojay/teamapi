# CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

This document captures the requirements for the CI/CD pipeline based on user needs:

1. Single comprehensive workflow instead of multiple overlapping workflows
   - Removed redundant backend-ci.yml in favor of a single combined-checks.yml
   - Renamed combined-checks.yml to reflect its purpose as the primary CI/CD pipeline

2. Independent job execution to prevent cascading failures
   - Parallelized jobs to run independently
   - Linting errors should not prevent security checks or other tests from running
   - All jobs should complete regardless of failures in other jobs
   - Added a summary job that depends on all other jobs completing

3. Improved developer feedback
   - Continue-on-error for non-critical checks (ESLint, MyPy)
   - Clearer job names and organization
   - Better error reporting with specific error messages

4. Security-focused pipeline
   - Dedicated security scanning jobs
   - Code quality analysis with CodeQL
   - Maintain all existing security checks

5. Efficiency considerations
   - Proper dependency caching
   - Optimized installation steps
   - Appropriate permissions for each job
