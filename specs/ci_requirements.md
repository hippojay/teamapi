# CI/CD Requirements

The following user needs have been identified for CI/CD implementation:

1. Need to run automated tests for the backend Python code on each push/PR to main branch
2. Need to run automated tests for the frontend React code on each push/PR to main branch
3. Need to scan codebase for security vulnerabilities using CodeQL
4. Need to check for outdated dependencies and security vulnerabilities in npm packages and Python libraries
5. Need to ensure code quality by running linters for both Python and JavaScript code
6. Need to automate test coverage reports to identify areas lacking proper testing
7. Need to apply these checks only to relevant files to avoid unnecessary builds
8. Need to schedule regular security scans even when no code changes occur (weekly)
9. Need to generate proper notifications for failing tests or security issues
10. Need for separate workflows to allow independent tracking and management of backend and frontend pipelines
11. Need to scan for secrets and sensitive information in the codebase using Gitleaks
12. Need to provide clear documentation for CI/CD setup and local test execution
13. Need to consolidate all checks into a combined workflow for single-status reporting
