# Logging Requirements

This document outlines the logging requirements and implementation for the "Who What Where" application.

## Identified Requirements

1. Application should use a standardized logging framework to ensure consistent logging across components
2. Logging should be configurable with different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
3. Logs should include timestamps and module information
4. Critical operations should be logged (database operations, authentication, data uploads)
5. Logs should be rotated to prevent excessive disk usage
6. Log files should be organized by module
7. Logs should help with debugging issues in production
8. Logging should support both console and file output
9. Detailed user action tracking through audit logs
10. Logging of security-related events (login attempts, password resets, etc.)
11. Error conditions should be properly logged with appropriate context
12. Performance metrics and database information should be logged
13. Critical business operations (data uploads, modifications) should be tracked

## Implementation Details

- Using the built-in Python `logging` module with extensions for rotation and formatting
- Logs are stored in the `/logs` directory by module name
- Each module gets its own logger instance with appropriate configuration
- Log files are rotated based on either size or time to prevent disk space issues
- Sensitive information is not logged directly (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Structured logging available for complex events with context
- Support for environment variable configuration of log levels

## Current Implementation

### Key Modules with Logging

1. **main.py** - Core application logging
   - Server startup and configuration
   - Database connection information
   - API endpoint activity
   - Authentication events
   - Data upload operations

2. **logger.py** - Central logging framework
   - Configurable log levels
   - Rotating file handlers
   - Console output options
   - Structured logging support

3. **db_initializer.py** - Database initialization logging
   - Schema creation events
   - Database version information
   - Initial setup processes
   - Migration tracking

4. **user_auth.py** - Authentication and user management logging
   - Login attempts (successful and failed)
   - User registration
   - Email verification
   - Password reset operations
   - Profile updates

### Security Considerations

- Passwords are never logged in plain text
- Tokens are partially masked (only first few characters shown)
- Failed authentication attempts are logged with appropriate context
- IP addresses and user agents should be logged for security auditing (future enhancement)

### Future Enhancements

1. Add centralized log aggregation
2. Implement log archiving for historical data
3. Add performance metric logging
4. Create dashboard for log visualization
5. Add automated alerting for critical log events
6. Implement comprehensive security event logging
