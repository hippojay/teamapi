# Logging System Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the application logging system in the "Who What Where" application.

## General Requirements

1. The application should maintain structured logs to support problem-solving and troubleshooting
2. Logs should be stored in a dedicated log directory
3. Log entries should capture date/time information in a standardized format
4. Log entries should include the module or activity being performed
5. Entries should be descriptive and capture useful state information
6. The system should support different logging levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
7. Logs should be rotated to prevent excessive disk usage

## Implementation Details

### Log Directory Structure
- All logs should be stored in the `/logs` directory at the project root
- Each module should have its own log file (e.g., `load_data.log`, `database.log`)

### Log Format
- Timestamp: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- Log level: Clear indication of the severity (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Module name: Which component generated the log
- Message: Descriptive information about the event
- Context data: Key-value pairs providing relevant state information

### Log Levels
- DEBUG: Detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems
- INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected
- WARNING: Indication that something unexpected happened, but the application still works
- ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the application has not been able to perform some function
- CRITICAL: A very serious error, indicating that the application may be unable to continue running

### Log Rotation
- Log files should be rotated based on size (default: 10MB)
- A configurable number of backup files should be kept (default: 5)
- Alternatively, time-based rotation (e.g., daily) should be supported

### Configuration
- Log level should be configurable via environment variables
- Console output should be toggleable for development environments

## Modules Requiring Logging

The following modules should implement logging:

1. Data loading modules (load_prod_data.py)
2. Database operations (database.py)
3. API endpoints (main.py) 
4. Authentication (auth.py)
5. CRUD operations (crud.py, entity_crud.py, search_crud.py, user_crud.py)
6. Database migration scripts (run_migration.py)

## Future Considerations

1. Integration with external monitoring tools
2. Log aggregation across multiple instances
3. Structured logging with JSON format for better searchability
4. Automated log analysis for error detection and reporting
