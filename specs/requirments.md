# Who What Where Requirements

## User Interface Testing Requirements

1. The application should load correctly and display the main layout components (header, sidebar, main content).
2. The header should be visible on all pages and contain the application name and navigation elements.
3. The sidebar menu should be visible and allow navigation to different sections of the application.
4. Clicking on sidebar menu items should navigate to the corresponding page.
5. Each page should display either relevant data or an appropriate "no data" message.
6. UI tests should verify basic application navigation, layout, and content visibility.
7. The application should not display error messages during normal navigation flows.
8. The Tribes page should correctly list available tribes or display a no-data message.
9. UI tests should be resilient to minor layout changes and loading delays.
11. Tests should have appropriate timeouts for UI element detection to accommodate application loading times.
12. The test selectors should be specific enough to uniquely identify elements, especially when multiple elements may have similar text.
13. Tests should use robust navigation techniques to ensure reliable page transitions.
14. The test suite should include logging to aid in debugging test failures.
